## Professional Experience

In my **Four years as an Analyst**, I've developed a deep passion for data management and analysis. My journey began at Exert Infotech, where I honed my skills in data visualization using Power BI and SQL queries. I excelled in utilizing MS Excel for complex data analysis, driving informed decisions and achieving a 90% client satisfaction rate.

My apprenticeship at Unum was a turning point in my career. I adeptly applied Agile methodologies to enhance ETL pipelines using Spark and Scala, reducing errors by 50%, and bolstered data security with Python scripts. My proficiency in Power BI and Azure Data Factory led to a 40% boost in operational efficiency.

Currently, as a **Database Analyst at Guardian Fueling Technologies**, my responsibilities encompass overseeing data infrastructure to ensure seamless data handling and analyzing diverse data sources. I write and manage automated data import/export jobs, optimize databases using SQL Server, write complex queries, and create reports in SSRS and Power BI. I also develop and deploy small-scale applications using JavaScript, Python, and Power Apps, deployed via Azure, to support internal company needs. My role involves leveraging APIs for seamless data integration, utilizing data modeling techniques, and contributing to monitoring, backup, and overall database management, enhancing performance and reliability.
